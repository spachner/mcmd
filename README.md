# mcmd
Repeat shell commands by mouse click (Mouse CoManD)

Are you often have to repeat shell commands? Are you tired by doing the same key strokes:

* Give the shell windows focus in order to type in
* Press up (maybe several times) to find the rght command to repeat
* Press enter to execute

Then mcmd could you save time. Once you have mcmd configured with commands you would like to repeat often, then just

* Click on button by mouse and you are done
