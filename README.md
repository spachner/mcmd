# mcmd
Repeat shell command by mouse click (Mouse CoManD)

Are you often have to repeat command in a shell?
Are you tired by also doing the same:
  o Give the shell windows focus in order to type in
  o Press up (maybe several times) to find the command to repeat or other keys to repeat the right command with right arguments
  o Press enter to execute
  
Then mcmd could save you time. Once you have mcmd configured with commands you would like to repeat often, then just
  o Click on button by mouse and you are done
