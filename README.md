# mcmd
Repeat shell commands by mouse click (Mouse CoManD)

Are you often have to repeat shell commands? Are you tired by doing the same key strokes:

* Give the shell windows focus in order to type in
* Press up (maybe several times) to find the rght command to repeat
* Press enter to execute

Then mcmd could you save time. Once you have mcmd configured with commands you would like to repeat often, then just

* Click on button by mouse and you are done

GUI buttons and commands are generated dynamically without any need to write Ruby code. Just provide an easy to understand config file. An example is generated by first start of _mcmd_
