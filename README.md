# mcmd
Repeat shell commands by mouse click (Mouse CoMmanD)

Are you often have to repeat shell commands? Are you tired by doing the same key strokes:

* Give the shell windows focus in order to type in
* Press up (maybe several times) to find the right command to repeat
* Press enter to execute

Then mcmd could you save time. Once you have mcmd configured with commands you would like to repeat often, then just

* Click on button by mouse and you are done

o GUI buttons and commands are generated dynamically without any need to write Ruby code
o Variable substition available. 
o Changes to commands already in config file can be done life in GUI and written back to config file
o An example config file is generated by first start of _mcmd_
